### Greetings! 👋


I like to talk about any subject in programming. I'm constantly looking for some learning and I'm passionate about SPA's, and coffee ☕

I was born in Santos-SP and I've always had a huge curiosity about technology and WEB development. I started programming at a young age, and entering college I developed a much greater taste for the thing.

Today I work with SPA's and Frontend, and I feel more and more motivated to create new experiences and do something really remarkable.

My main hobbies when I'm not programming(rs) are games and music 😍. I find it amazing how music can affect focus and make the experience of working so much more fun and immersive.

- 🌱 Currently my focus is on studying Typescript in interfaces with Vue.js an React.js. If you parachuted around here and are also interested in these technologies, ping me to have a chat, I'd love to learn and share knowledge.

It was a pleasure having you here 😃
See ya!
