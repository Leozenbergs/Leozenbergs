## Greetings! 🖖

### Career
Hello, my name is Leonardo and I am a software developer with over 5 years of experience. I have a strong foundation in programming languages, frameworks, and libraries, including Vue.js, React.js, Node.js, and Python.

During my career, I have been responsible for developing new interfaces for legacy products, as well as maintaining and implementing automated tests. I have also led micro-frontend development teams and implemented features using GraphQL.

In addition, I have experience developing systems and landing pages using WordPress, CodeIgniter, JavaScript, jQuery, and MySQL.

I am a motivated professional with a strong sense of responsibility and teamwork. I am always looking to learn new technologies and challenges.

### About me

I like to talk about any subject in programming. I'm constantly looking for some learning and I'm passionate about SPA's, and coffee ☕

I was born in Santos-SP and I've always had a huge curiosity about technology and WEB development. I started programming at a young age, and entering college I developed a much greater taste for the thing.

Today I work with SPA's and Frontend, and I feel more and more motivated to create new experiences and do something really remarkable.

My main hobbies when I'm not programming(rs) are games and music 😍. I find it amazing how music can affect focus and make the experience of working so much more fun and immersive.

- 📖 Currently my focus is on studying architectures and Serverless.

### Contact me :)
