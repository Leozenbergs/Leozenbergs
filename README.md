### Greetings! 👋

I like to talk about any subject in programming. I'm constantly looking for some learning and I'm passionate about SPA's, and coffee :coffee:

I was born in Santos-SP and I've always had a huge curiosity about technology and WEB development. I started programming at a young age, and entering college I developed a much greater taste for the thing :sunglasses:.

Today I work with SPA's and Frontend, and I feel more and more motivated to create new experiences and do something really remarkable :yum:.

My main hobbies when I'm not programming(rs) are games and music :heart_eyes:. I find it amazing how music can affect focus and make the experience of working so much more fun and immersive.

- 🌱 Currently my focus is on studying Typescript in interfaces with Vue.js (specifically :innocent:). If you parachuted around here and are also interested in these technologies, call me to exchange an idea, I love to exchange and share knowledge.

- 📫 You can find me also through my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardoabreurodrigues/)

It was a pleasure having you here :smiley:
See ya!
